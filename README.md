# Game Theory Codes

This repository contains implementations of various games and simulations based on game theory principles. Game theory is a branch of mathematics and economics that studies strategic interactions between rational decision-makers.

## Introduction

Game theory provides a framework to analyze decision-making in competitive situations where the outcome of one participant's decision depends on the decisions of others. This repository serves as a collection of Python implementations of classic games and simulations based on game theory concepts.

## Games Implemented

Currently, the repository includes implementations of the following games:

- **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A classic example of a non-zero-sum game where two rational individuals may not cooperate even if it is in their best interests to do so.

- **Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma**: Extends the Prisoner's Dilemma over multiple rounds, allowing strategies to evolve and adapt based on previous interactions.

- **... (more games will be added soon)**

## How to Use

To run any of the games in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the respective game's directory. Use Python to execute the main script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Game_Theory_Codes.git
cd Game_Theory_Codes/game_name
python game_name.py
```

Replace `game_name` with the name of the game directory you want to run.
